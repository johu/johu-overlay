# Welcome to the dev/johu overlay

This is my Gentoo developer overlay where I develop and maintain ebuilds for
experimental packages.

The overlay is hosted on Github and on the official Gentoo Overlays
infrastructure at:

- <https://github.com/johu/johu-overlay>
- <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/dev/johu.git>

If you have questions, you can find me on IRC in #gentoo-dev on Freenode or at
[johu@gentoo.org](mailto:johu@gentoo.org).
